# Heracles

### Description
Heracles is a workout tracker web application that allows users to create, view, and track daily workouts. This application is built using .NET 9 for the back end, and the front end has not been developed yet. The application uses Azure AD for authentication and authorization. It is designed to be hosted in a Docker or Kubernetes environment and uses PostgreSQL as the database. The included `docker-compose` file can be used as a reference for setting up the application in a Docker environment. More information on setting up the application will be added once it is fully finished.

### Requirements
This project requires an Azure AD tenant and a registered application in Azure AD. The application must also have the role of 'admin' in the Azure AD tenant.
